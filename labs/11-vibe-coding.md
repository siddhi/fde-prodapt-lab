# Lab 11: Vibe Coding an Annotation Tool

Did you find it tiring to do the open coding exercise with the Excel sheet?

Given that developers and domain experts will be repeatedly doing the same exercise over and over again, over 100 or more samples, then it makes sense to have an interface that makes it easy to do this.

In this lab, we will build a tool to make it easier to do annotations. Because this is an internal tool that won't go to production, we will just vibe code it!

It needs to:

- Read the CSV of eval input and outputs
- Display it on the screen in a way that is easy to read and evaluate
- Allow the annotator to mark "pass" or "fail". If "fail" they can give a reason
- Show on the UI which samples have been annotated and how many are remaining
- Automatically move to the next sample after a sample has been annotated

This is a free form lab. Just open the vibe coding tool that you like, and have fun!

At the end, we will all show 5 minute demos of the app that we built.
